                        Every day I ask why I struggle so,<br>
                        When it comes to finding the girl for me,<br>
                        It seems so simple in those love songs though, <br>
                        I say at night, thinking ‘bout how to be.<br>
                        There’s a girl I like, but I’m feel’n helpless,<br>
                        Can’t move a muscle when I catch her gaze,<br>
                        All my friends tell me to not be reckless<br>
                        I know how to solve it, there’s many ways.<br>
                        I just don’t have the confidence I need,<br>
                        To ask her for the love I deeply seek,<br>
                        I keep thinking ‘bout how I could succeed,<br>
                        How I could ask out the girl most unique.<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope to soon profess my love to her,<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And give her the rich love she does deserve.<br>

                        On that day in the middle of the year,<br>
                        For the first time ever, I caught her gaze,<br>
                        Awash with sunshine while in the frontier,<br>
                        I’ll always remember her stunning rays<br>
                        A few weeks later, her soft hand in mine,<br>
                        Laying on a cloud, thinking what to do,<br>
                        We could go to dinner and share some wine,<br>
                        Or take a stroll, our bare feet touching dew.<br>
                        After a while, we were never apart,<br>
                        We barely felt like two different people,<br>
                        Sitting there with her, still fluttered my heart,<br>
                        Imagining when I’d see that steeple,<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I would give to keep it forever,<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our deep rich love I hope will not sever.<br>

                        Our eyes connect, I am elated,<br>
                        Just looking at her, a connection is created.<br>
                        Although shy, she makes all smile,<br>
                        Sadly, we haven’t talked in a while.<br>
                        I know she likes me, without a doubt,<br>
                        Whenever I pass, she looks about,<br>
                        Trying not to make it weird.<br>
                        I want her to know not to be afeared.<br>
                        I only want to give her joy,<br>
                        I feel like the luckiest boy,<br>
                        To have an inkling of a chance,<br>
                        To ask her for a dance,<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish she knew how special she is,<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope she one day won’t just be Miss<br>

                        Respect is to most a forgotten fact,<br>

                        For them disrespect was the worst of crimes.<br>
                        But now the youth don’t have morality,<br>
                        To have decency, kindness, and respect<br>
                        They feel those traits a weak formality,<br>
                        And have no idea the strong effect.<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The customs of the past are out of style,<br>
